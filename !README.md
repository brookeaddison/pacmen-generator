#Pacmen Generator:
The PacMen project was assigned and developed to further teach 
and practice the fundamentals of manipulating styles, using 
array methods, and manipulating the DOM. 

#How to run:
To run this project on your machine the first thing you need
is to clone all the files in this repository to your machine.
Drag and drop the index.html file onto your browser window.

#Roadmap to future Improvements:
In the future I plan to add an update in which each pacman 
generated alternates between an open and closed mouth as it 
bounces around the screen utilizing each of the four image files 
I have rather than just two.
